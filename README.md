## Foxer Framework

**A lightweight easy to learn, use and extend open-source framework for 2D games
over the C++ programming language**. That's the main goal of the Foxer Framework.
It hopes to provide practical (yet simple) usage of Object-Oriented Programming
for a game that can be built with any text editor.

**Code simplicity and readability** are two of its objects, being able to
express the demo in the GIF with only about 299 lines of code
(which 97 are for headers).

**It uses [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org) and supports
[Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) orthogonal maps!** For Tiled, you just
need to export (save) everything it creates (tilesets and tilemaps) in JSON
and Foxer can understand it into a visual and collidable level.

Let a fox help your code to be swift and smart, like a fox.
